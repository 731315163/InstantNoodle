Inspired by and based on Rod Hyde's Messenger:
http://www.unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=CSharpMessenger

This is a C# messenger (notification center). It uses delegates
and generics to provide type-checked messaging between event producers and
event consumers, without the need for producers or consumers to be aware of
each other. The major improvement from Hyde's implementation is that
there is more extensive error detection, preventing silent bugs.
